# Kinematics-of-the-Stewart-Platform
This project explores two numerical methods of finding roots (x) of non-linear equations which satisfy the
equation f(x) = 0. We use the Bisection and Newton-Raphson methods to find roots of the given equation
and we state reasons why we prefer one method over another. We also briefly discuss why we are not using
Fixed-point iteration method to solve the given problem. This project uses the non-linear equations derived
for the Stewart Platform titled as Kinematics of the Stewart Platform presented in Chapter 1 of the book by
Timothy Sauer, 3rd edition. We see that we can get approximate roots with fewer iterations if we are able to
plot the function and find the intervals containing true roots.
